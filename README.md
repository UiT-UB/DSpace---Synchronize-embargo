# DSpace-Synchronize-embargo
Synchronize file embargo and metadata embargo values in DSpace

This script reads file/bitstream embargo values from items in DSpace and sets a metadata field to the same value. This might be useful when you are already using the file embargo feature, but also have implemented the requirements for compliance with the OpenAIRE standard. This standard requires a certain metadata field containing the item's embargo end date.
